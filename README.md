# National Statistics Data Warehouse

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **Data Warehouse** for national-level statistics using multiple data source types.

The goal is to design and implement a clean **end-to-end DWH architecture** starting from raw data sources up to an analytical-ready warehouse.

## Business Purpose
The warehouse enables historical analysis of national indicators such as:
- Population statistics
- Economic indicators

The focus is on **trend analysis over time** and **comparisons across regions**.

## Data Sources
This project uses multiple data source types:
- **CSV files**: Population statistics
- **REST API (JSON)**: Economic indicators

## Architecture (High Level)
- Landing Zone (raw data)
- Staging Zone (cleansed and transformed data)
- Data Warehouse (analytical model)

## Tools & Technologies
- PostgreSQL
- Pentaho Data Integration (Spoon)
- SQL
- Git & GitHub

## Project Status
🚧 In progress — Database setup and landing zone design.
